# ER Diagrams
### Chen Notation Diagram

#### Questions:

How should we approach songs/albums with multiple artists? For simplicity sake, should we just keep it at 1? That's how I currently have it

Do we need both a username and userID? Maybe users are required to have a unique user ID

Should artist be an extension of user? If we separate them, we could probably make "member" into its own entity

#### Changes:

Changed "producers" to "record label" to avoid the complexity of multiple producers

Added "album classification", indicating whether an album is a single, EP, compilation, etc

Removed the "most popular locaiton" attribute for artist. We can add it back, but I don't think they actually have that data on spotify :P

Added foreign keys to connect entities in the crow's foot diagram
