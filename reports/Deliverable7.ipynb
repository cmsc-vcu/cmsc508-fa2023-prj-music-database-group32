        "\n",
        "We aim to create a music database, focusing on the domain of music, which is defined as the combination of vocal or instrumental sounds to create beauty, harmony, and express emotion. Music has a rich history, initially serving purposes such as imitating nature, frightening predators, and aiding communication. Some argue that even in ancient times, music was used to convey emotions, a purpose it continues to serve today.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key historical milestones include the Hurrian Hymn No. 6, recognized as the world’s earliest melody, and the Seikilos Epitaph, the oldest known musical composition inscribed in Greek on a tombstone. Early musical notations were depicted with symbols above Greek characters. The concept of music classification, including genres, has evolved over time. The term “genre” was coined by Aristotle and Plato for literature, while Franco Fabbri proposed a comprehensive definition of “musical genre” in 1982.\n",
        "\n",
        "The development of music recording technology has played a crucial role. The first recorded album dates back to 1889, recorded by Emile Berliner using a gramophone. The digital era saw the creation of the first digital music store, the Internet Underground Music Archive, in 1993. The advent of personal devices like the iPod led to the rise of music streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, which track songs, artists, and albums. Legitimate databases like Jaxsta, MusicBrainz, and LastFM have emerged, providing comprehensive information, including BPM, key, and mood.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Need\n",
        "\n",
        "A music database is a useful discovery tool, suggesting new music and crafting personalized playlists based on user preferences like genre, tempo, and mood. It simplifies the organization of music collections, making it easier to sort and order songs. This is particularly helpful for users frustrated by scattered music across different devices and apps.\n",
        "\n",
        "Acting as a personal music library manager, the database makes searches for specific songs, genres, albums, artists, release years, and other music-related factors more efficient. Beyond enhancing the listening experience for general users, it’s especially beneficial for those in musical professions such as musicians, DJs, and songwriters. Additionally, it helps identify songs that complement each other, by looking at things like similar BPMs, for a more enjoyable and entertaining musical journey.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Context, scope and perspective\n",
        "\n",
        "This database is for everyone who loves music and wants to explore more about the songs they listen to. It’s especially beneficial for music enthusiasts, students, and musicians who seek detailed information like BPM, key, and time signatures. The database is a handy tool for language learners using song lyrics for practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Users can search for songs based on mood and genre, making it a valuable resource for discovering new music aligned with their preferences. Whether you enjoy exploring different moods or discovering songs by specific genres or songwriters, this database caters to a diverse range of music lovers.\n",
        "\n",
        "# User roles and use cases\n",
        "\n",
        "The users of our music database fall into different roles. **Free listeners** enjoy basic features like shuffling and searching for songs, musicians, and albums. **Premium listeners**, on the other hand, get more, with the ability to create playlists and play specific songs. Meanwhile, **music artists**, in addition to premium features, can add songs and create albums. This tiered approach caters to varying needs, ensuring a simple and enjoyable experience for all users. The database will connect seamlessly with these user roles, allowing free and premium listeners to explore and organize their music, while encouraging music artists to contribute and manage their creations.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Security and Privacy\n",
        "\n",
        "In our music database, we prioritize security and privacy. Listeners are restricted from altering information beyond their playlists, ensuring controlled access. Similarly, artists are limited to modifying only their playlists. To safeguard user accounts, each person has usernames, passwords, and user IDs, employing robust user authentication measures. These precautions are integral to maintaining a secure and private environment for all users, assuring that their personal information and interactions within the database remain protected.\n",

        "One thought that we had was to possibly have an album be a more specific type of playlist (a playlist that only an artist can make). However, we also wanted to include features that only playlists could have (i.e. discriptions). It also seemed unnecessary to connect albums and playlists, so we ultimately decided not to.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also had to consider which relationships to make many-to-many. Songs are often by multiple artist, so we made that relationship many-to-many. Though albums aren’t as often by multiple artist, we thought it would be the most consistent to also make that relationship many-to-many. Though songs can also be on multiple albums, they often show up as separate songs on music apps like Spotify, so we decided to keep that relationship as one-to-many.\n",
